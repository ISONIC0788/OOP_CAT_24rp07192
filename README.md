# OOP_CAT_24rp07192

Welcome to the OOP_CAT_24rp07192 repository!

## Overview

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, with a focus on Java (JDK 25). It covers fundamental principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The repository also includes examples and exercises for learning Java’s Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) for building GUI applications.

## Features

- Example Java classes illustrating core OOP concepts
- Exercises and solutions for practical learning
- Clear code structure for easy navigation
- Documentation for each topic
- AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) sample programs for GUI development

## Java AWT Concept (JDK 25)

AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is Java’s original platform-dependent windowing, graphics, and user-interface widget toolkit. With JDK 25, AWT remains a foundational technology for basic GUI applications.

**AWT Topics Covered:**
- Creating windows, frames, and panels
- Handling user events (buttons, mouse, keyboard)
- Layout managers (FlowLayout, BorderLayout, GridLayout)
- Basic controls (Button, Label, TextField, Checkbox, Choice, List)
- Drawing graphics using the `Graphics` class
- Simple AWT application examples

All AWT examples are written using Java JDK 25 syntax and conventions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 25 installed
- A code editor like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd OOP_CAT_24rp07192
   ```
3. Open the code in your preferred Java IDE.

## Usage

- Explore the `/src` directory for OOP and AWT examples.
- Compile and run Java files using your IDE or the command line:
  ```bash
  javac ExampleAWT.java
  java ExampleAWT
  ```
- Complete exercises in the `/exercises` directory to practice OOP and AWT concepts.
